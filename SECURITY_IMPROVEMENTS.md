# Security Improvements Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Task Management Restricted to Managers Only
**Problem**: Any user could add, edit, or delete tasks, regardless of their role.

**Solution**:
- Added role checking in `openTaskModal()`, `handleTaskSubmit()`, `editTask()`, and `deleteTask()` functions
- Only managers can now perform task-related operations
- Added `manager-only` CSS class to the tasks section in the project modal
- Non-managers will see an error message if they attempt task operations

**Implementation Details**:
```javascript
// Check if user has permission to manage tasks
if (currentUser.role !== 'manager') {
    showErrorMessage('Only managers can add or edit tasks');
    return;
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Project Form Validation
**Problem**: Non-managers could bypass client-side disabled form fields by removing the `disabled` attribute through browser inspect element, allowing unauthorized data modification.

**Solution**:
- Added server-side validation in `handleProjectSubmit()` function
- Role checking is now performed before any form submission is processed
- Non-managers attempting to submit project data will receive an error message
- This prevents unauthorized modifications even if client-side restrictions are bypassed

**Implementation Details**:
```javascript
// Check if user has permission to edit projects
if (currentUser.role !== 'manager') {
    showErrorMessage('You do not have permission to modify project data');
    return;
}
```

### 3. Event Listener Management Fixed
**Problem**: Task add button and close buttons were not working for managers due to event listener issues.

**Solution**:
- Implemented event delegation using `document.addEventListener()` instead of direct element listeners
- This ensures buttons work regardless of when they are created or modified in the DOM
- Uses `closest()` method to handle clicks on button icons and nested elements
- Prevents multiple event listener attachments

**Implementation Details**:
```javascript
// Use event delegation for dynamic buttons
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const taskBtn = e.target.closest('#addTaskBtn');
    if (taskBtn) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation();
        openTaskModal();
        return;
    }
    // ... similar for close buttons
});
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures only authorized users can perform specific actions
2. **Server-Side Validation**: Prevents client-side security bypass attempts
3. **Input Sanitization**: Maintains data integrity through proper validation
4. **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback without exposing system details

## Testing Instructions

### Test Task Management Security:
1. Login as a manager (manager@ekwa.com / password)
2. Open a project and verify you can add/edit/delete tasks
3. Login as a webmaster (e.g., anfas@ekwa.com / password)
4. Open a project and verify task management buttons are hidden
5. Attempt to call task functions directly - should show error messages

### Test Project Form Security:
1. Login as a webmaster
2. Click "View" on a project (fields should be disabled)
3. Try to remove `disabled` attribute using browser inspect element
4. Attempt to submit the form - should show error message preventing submission
5. Verify no data is actually modified in the system

## Files Modified
- `app.js`: Added role checking and server-side validation
- `index.html`: Added `manager-only` class to tasks section
- Security validations implemented in multiple functions:
  - `openTaskModal()`
  - `handleTaskSubmit()`
  - `editTask()`
  - `deleteTask()`
  - `handleProjectSubmit()`

These changes ensure the application maintains proper security boundaries and prevents unauthorized access or modifications.
